# Sales_Analysis_Project 

## Overview: 
This project showcases my expertise in using Excel, SQL, and Tableau to analyze a sales dataset. The dataset contains information about sales revenue, customer behavior, and market dynamics. 
## Outcome:
The analysis provided valuable insights that can be used to inform future business decisions, such as identifying top-performing products, understanding customer behavior, and optimizing marketing strategies. The project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel, SQL, and Tableau. 

## Project Tasks:  
1.	Data Cleaning: The first task was to clean the data by removing duplicates, fixing missing values, and correcting data types. I used Excel to do this task, which involved a lot of manual work.
2.	Data Analysis: After cleaning the data, I used SQL to analyze the sales revenue and create a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. This involved using a variety of SQL techniques such as basic SQL queries, subqueries, CTEs, aggregate functions, and window functions.
3.	Data Visualization: To visualize the results, I used Tableau to create interactive dashboards that provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and market dynamics. I created two dashboards, the first one shows sales trends and the second one shows customer segmentation analysis.
